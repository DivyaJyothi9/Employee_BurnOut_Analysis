The model helps in identifying employees who are at risk of burnout, enabling organizations to take proactive measures to reduce stress and improve employee well-being.

### Key Highlights:
- **Machine Learning Models**: Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Tech Stack**:  Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Google Colab
- **Goal**: To predict the **Burn Rate** (a metric indicating employee burnout) based on various employee-related features.
