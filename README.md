# Employee Burnout Analysis - Machine Learning Model

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict employee burnout based on several factors such as mental fatigue, resource allocation, designation, and more. The model helps in identifying employees who are at risk of burnout, enabling organizations to take proactive measures to reduce stress and improve employee well-being.

### Key Highlights:
- **Machine Learning Models**: Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- 
- **Tech Stack**:Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Google Colab
- 
- **Goal**: To predict the **Burn Rate** (a metric indicating employee burnout) based on various employee-related features.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-burnout-analysis.git
   cd employee-burnout-analysis
Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, if you're working in Google Colab, no installation is necessary, as all required libraries are available by default.

## Data
The dataset used in this project includes the following columns:

**Employee ID:** Unique identifier for employees

**Gender:** Gender of the employee

**Company Type:** Type of company (e.g., Service, Product)

**WFH Setup Available:** Whether the employee has a Work-From-Home setup

**Designation:** Job designation

**Resource Allocation:** The amount of resources allocated to the employee

**Mental Fatigue Score:** Employee's mental fatigue score

**Burn Rate:** The target variable indicating the risk of burnout

Data was processed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

## System Approach
**System Requirements:**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Python Version: 3.8+

**Libraries:**

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-Learn

**Libraries Required:**

**Pandas** For data manipulation and cleaning

**NumPy:** For numerical operations

**Matplotlib and Seaborn:** For data visualization

**Scikit-Learn:** For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation

## Algorithm & Model
Steps to Complete the Project:

Data Loading: Load the dataset using Pandas.

Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values using dropna().

Convert 'Date of Joining' column to datetime and create a 'Days' column representing the number of days since joining.

Drop unnecessary columns like 'Employee ID' and 'Days'.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Plot distributions of numerical features like Mental Fatigue Score, Resource Allocation, and Burn Rate.
Perform correlation analysis to identify relationships between features.
**One-Hot Encoding:**

Convert categorical features (Gender, Company Type, WFH Setup Available) to numerical format using pd.get_dummies().
## Model Training:

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Scale the features using StandardScaler.

Train a Linear Regression model and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model.

## Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the models using performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R-Squared.

## Evaluation
**Linear Regression Model:**
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.003

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.056

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.046

R-Squared (R2): 0.92

**KNN Regression Model:**
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.003

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.058

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.046

R-Squared (R2): 0.91

## Deployment
Google Colab was used for the development and testing of this project.
The trained models can be deployed in any web application or used within an organization to predict employee burnout based on their data.
